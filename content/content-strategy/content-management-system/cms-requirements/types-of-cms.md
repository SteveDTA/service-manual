There are many CMS systems to choose from. Two common types of CMS are known as 'open source' and 'proprietary'.

### [2]Open source vs proprietary CMS
**Open source** is when the code is open to be developed collaboratively by a community of developers around the world. Two of the more well known open source CMS examples include WordPress and Drupal. There are many more. 

**Proprietary systems** are owned, built and maintained by a company. The code is not open and available. It can only be worked on by internal developers specific to that CMS company.

#### [3]Benefits of open source
- code is freely available
- usually have a strong network of online support
- transparent in its development
- frequently updated
- can be quickly customised

#### [3]Risks of open source
- can have a steep learning curve
- can be less secure, though patches and updates are regular 
- noone 'owns' the code, so there is no fall back person or company

#### [3]Benefits of proprietary
- provides a fully pre-built system ready to use 'off the shelf'
- maintenance and upgrades of the CMS are managed externally by the company
- are usually quite robust and reliable

#### [3]Risks of proprietary
- can be expensive
- code cannot be freely worked on outise of the company who own the CMS
- you can be locked into a system or contract
- can be costly to move away from

Also consider who will build and maintain your CMS, whether open source or proprietary.

#### [3]Do your due diligence

When choosing a CMS, it's helpful to ask lots of questions so that you consider all the risks and constraints associated with the CMS you choose. The Digital Service Standard also outlines why it's important to [understand tools and systems](/digital-service-standard/4-tools-and-systems/) before you decide to use them.
