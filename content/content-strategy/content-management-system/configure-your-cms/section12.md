Migrating content is all about careful and safe content management. If you do need to change to a different CMS, you'll need a clear exit plan. This involves migrating content and is part of your content strategy.

Migrating content from one CMS to another can be a very large job. The bigger your site, the larger the move. Badly implemented content migration can result in poor site performance, SEO, quality of traffic, and impact greatly on the user experience.

There are several questions to ask before you start and to engage all [CMS stakeholders](/content-strategy/content-management-system/cms-requirements/#cms-stakeholders) in the process. 

Ensure to answer each of these questions thoroughly.
- Why are you migrating content?
- What content do you need to move or remove? 
- What is the process for moving content?
- How will data be preserved when you move it across?
- Will your SEO be affected?
- Who is responsible for the migration of content?
- What content backups will be made before and after the move?
- How will you know if your content has been successfully migrated and/or stored?
- Who will set up content in the new CMS?
