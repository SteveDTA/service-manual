There are several CMS terms and labels (taxonomy) to become familiar with when using a CMS. Some common terms include:
- Content pages — standard pages that you will create and add content to in the CMS
- Page id — the unique identification reference number automatically assigned by the CMS to each page on your site. 
- Landing pages — the website pages that users will land on from search engines or a link. 
- Assets: images, downloads, attachments etc that you use on different pages of your site.
- Metadata — page titles, descriptions, SEO tags and labels used to describe different types of content.
- Categories and topics — the way you structure content in your CMS so that users can easily navigate your site and find information.

When CMS taxonomy is used correctly, both your [SEO](/content-strategy/search-engine-optimisation/) and [information architecture](/content-strategy/information-architecture/) will also be improved. This will create a better user experience.

Content in your CMS should be structured based on your content types and your information architecture. Use your content categories and topics to clearly label and structure content clearly in your CMS. Refer also to [taxonomy](/content-strategy/information-architecture/plan-ia/#build-out-your-taxonomy) in the IA guidance for more on this.
